# AGENTS.md — rules for every AI agent in this repo

Claude Code (through `CLAUDE.md`) and CodeRabbit both read this file. It is the single source of rules: product context, stack, layout, content accuracy, human gates and review guidelines. Requirements live in `docs/PRD.md`, and the PRD wins any conflict.

## Product in one paragraph
Risk Trainer is a hosted, no-login web app that teaches security risk prioritization. A learner gets a scenario with five findings and limited remediation capacity, chooses a CISSP risk response for each (avoid / mitigate / transfer / accept), and gets a deterministic score, an expert debrief and a peer comparison. The app makes no LLM calls. The owner drafts scenarios with Claude through a local authoring MCP server; learners can optionally get coached in their own Claude through a public, read-only MCP endpoint. The whole thing must run at $0 beyond the owner's Claude subscription.

Principles: accuracy before volume (only owner-approved content reaches learners) · the score is deterministic · private by default (no accounts, no stored free text) · cheap to run and hard to abuse · teach the manager mindset (risk = likelihood × impact; CVSS isn't risk; the risk owner accepts risk, not security). Voice: direct and practical, a security manager coaching a new analyst.

## Source of truth and workflow
- `docs/PRD.md` → the approved Claude Code plan for each group → code.
- Work in plan mode first. Don't edit files until the owner approves the plan.
- A change that alters behavior updates the matching PRD acceptance criteria in the same pull request and names the requirement IDs.
- Record decisions that change the plan in `docs/decisions.md` (date, decision, reason).

## Human gates: agents never do these
- Run `rt approve` or `rt retire`, or edit `status`, `reviewed_by` or `reviewed_on` in any scenario.
- Run `terraform apply` or `terraform destroy`, or change anything in `infra/bootstrap/`.
- Push to `main`, merge pull requests, or change branch rulesets or environment protection.
- Create, rotate or print secrets. Ask the owner to do it and say exactly what's needed.
- Dismiss a security finding from CodeRabbit or CI. List it for the owner instead.

## Stack (fixed)
- **Python ≥ 3.12** (newest version Lambda supports as a managed runtime), **uv** with a committed lockfile.
- **FastAPI** + **Jinja2** server-rendered templates + **htmx 2.x**, vendored. No Node or JavaScript build step and no CDN scripts.
- **Pydantic v2** (and `pydantic-settings`), **PyYAML** `safe_load` only, **Typer** for the `rt` CLI.
- **MCP:** the official MCP Python SDK (`mcp` package). Authoring server over stdio; learner server as stateless streamable HTTP with JSON responses.
- **AWS:** CloudFront (Free flat-rate plan where eligible), Lambda, DynamoDB (provisioned, always-free capacity, TTL), SSM Parameter Store (standard tier), CloudWatch, SNS, AWS Budgets. **Terraform ≥ 1.10**, S3 backend with `use_lockfile = true`.
- **Quality:** ruff (including `S` security rules), mypy (strict for `domain/` and `content/`), pytest + pytest-cov, moto, Playwright (Python), gitleaks, pip-audit, checkov. `make check` runs lint, types, tests and `rt validate`.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, OIDC to AWS, Terraform apply gated by the protected `prod` environment.

## Cost rules ($0 target)
Never add a resource that bills outside the always-free allowance without the owner's written approval in `docs/decisions.md`. That includes: any paid LLM API, NAT gateways, standalone AWS WAF, provisioned concurrency, API Gateway (unless the plan justifies its cost), Route 53 hosted zones or domains, KMS customer-managed keys, Secrets Manager (use SSM standard), and log retention over 14 days.

## Repository layout
```
AGENTS.md  CLAUDE.md  .mcp.json  README.md  Makefile  pyproject.toml  uv.lock
docs/PRD.md  docs/decisions.md
content/scenarios/      approved only; packaged into deployments
content/drafts/         never deployed; the only folder save_draft may write to
prompts/coach_me.md     versioned with code
src/risk_trainer/
  domain/               pure logic: treatments, scoring, models. No I/O.
  content/              YAML loading and validation
  storage/              DynamoDB repositories: attempts, aggregates, rate limits
  web/                  FastAPI app, routers, templates/, static/
  mcp/                  authoring.py (stdio), learner.py (HTTP at /mcp)
  cli/                  Typer app: rt validate | approve | retire | preview | mcp
  config.py             pydantic-settings; the only place env vars are read
tests/unit  tests/integration (moto)  tests/e2e (Playwright)
infra/bootstrap/ (owner applies once)  infra/modules/  infra/envs/{dev,prod}/
.github/workflows/
```
Dependencies point inward: `web` and `mcp` → `storage` → `domain`. `domain/` imports nothing from boto3, FastAPI or `mcp`; a test enforces this.

## Engineering standards
- **Errors:** typed exceptions from `domain/`, caught at the boundary (routes, CLI commands, MCP tools) and mapped to plain messages. No bare `except`, no swallowed errors, no stack traces to users or MCP clients.
- **Logging:** structured JSON with a request ID. No `print`. Never log rationale text, overall notes, cookies or secrets.
- **Security:** no `eval`/`exec`; Jinja autoescape on; CSRF on every POST; server-side length limits on all input; strict CSP (no inline scripts, `on*=` handlers or `style=` attributes).
- **MCP:** tool and prompt descriptions are static strings in code. The authoring server exposes exactly the five tools in PRD §8.1 and resolves every write path inside `content/drafts/`. The learner server never returns answer-key fields from `get_scenario`.
- **AWS:** IAM scoped to specific actions and resource ARNs; document any required wildcard inline. boto3 clients set explicit timeouts and retries. Tag every resource `project = "risk-trainer"` and `env`.
- **Tests:** every requirement has a test, named with its ID where practical (`test_r17_rejects_path_outside_drafts`). Unit tests never call real AWS.
- **Dependencies:** add one only with a one-line reason in the plan and `docs/decisions.md`.
- **GitHub Actions:** pin third-party actions to a commit SHA.
- **Review workflow:** The review workflow's GITHUB_TOKEN is read-only. It keeps id-token: write, which claude-code-action needs for its GitHub App token. Its --allowedTools allows only the inline-comment tool; that line is what stops the reviewer from pushing, so never widen it without the owner's approval.

## Content accuracy rules
- Use CISSP terms: **avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept**. "Fix" (remediate) and "reduce" (compensating control) are forms of mitigation, never separate categories. Ignoring a risk is never valid.
- Transfer shifts financial impact; accountability, regulatory duties and reputational impact stay. Acceptance is a documented decision by the risk owner or senior management; security recommends.
- Organizations are fictional and labeled "(fictional)". No real company names, real CVE IDs, vendor or product names.
- Each scenario's preferred answers cover at least three of the four responses. `expert_rationale` ≤ 120 words, in the owner's voice.
- All content is original. Never reproduce or paraphrase ISC2 practice questions or study-guide text. "CISSP" appears only descriptively; the About page states there is no affiliation with ISC2.
- Any learner-visible change to an approved scenario bumps `version` and returns it to `draft`.

## Review guidelines
Reviewers (CodeRabbit and humans) should flag, as high severity:
- Anything that logs or stores rationale text, or returns answer-key fields before a submission.
- Any tool, command or code path that lets an agent approve content or edit review fields.
- Any AWS resource or setting on the cost list above.
- Wildcard IAM, secrets in code or config, unpinned third-party actions, inline scripts.
- A requirement ID implemented without a test, or a behavior change without a PRD update.
- Any change that widens the review workflow's permissions or --allowedTools.

## Definition of done for any task
1. `make check` passes locally.
2. The commit message names the requirement IDs covered.
3. Any new configuration value is documented in `README.md` with its default.
